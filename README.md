## Welcome!


Hi! I'm Syl(any pronouns). I'm 23 and currently a PhD student at the University of Warwick where I apply computational techniques to renormalisation group methods in quantum physics. More generally I am interested in topological matter, how it intersects with mathematicss and how that can be investigated via a computer.
