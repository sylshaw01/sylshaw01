## Welcome!


Hi! I'm Syl(any pronouns). I'm 23 and currently a PhD student at Warwick University where I apply computational techniques to renormalisation group methods in quantum physics. More generally I am interested in topological matter, how it intersects with maths and how that can be investigated with a computer.
If you would like to contact me, you can do so via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sylshaw01/) or discord where I go by the handle @syl.s
